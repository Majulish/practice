# collatz-conjecture

The [collatz-conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a unique mathematical problem that has not been solved yet. It is also known as the 3n+1 problem. Seemingly simple, the conjecture is actually quite complex.

The conjecture states that for any positive integer n, if n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1. Repeat the process indefinitely. The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1. 

So far up to 2^68 has been solved with no number breaking the pattern.
